Simple Gym Management System
This is a  basic lightweight, console-based Python application designed to help gym owners or administrators manage their member records efficiently.

I built this to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, specifically focusing on class structures, dictionary management, and user input handling.

 What Can It Do?


This tool handles the basics of gym administration without needing a complex database. Here are the main features:

1.  Add New Members: Inputs details like ID, Name, Age, and Gender.

2.  Smart BMI Calculator: Automatically calculates a member's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the weight (kg) and height (m) you provide during registration.

3.  Member Lookup: Search for a specific member by their ID to see their contact info and health status (Underweight, Normal, or Overweight).

4.  View Directory: Displays a clean, formatted table of all currently registered members.

5.  Remove Members: Deletes members from the system when they cancel their subscription.

6.  exit: exit from program

 How It Works (Under the Hood)
The project uses two main classes:

Member: Acts as a blueprint for a single person, holding data like ID, name, and calculated BMI.

GymManager: The engine of the app. It uses a Python Dictionary ({}) to store members for fast lookups (O(1) time complexity) using the Member ID as the key.

 How to Run It
You don't need to install any external libraries! This runs on standard Python.

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6+ recommended).

Save the code into a file named gym_system.py.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the command:

Bash

python gym_system.py
 Example Usage
Once the program starts, you will see a menu like this:

1. Add Member
2. View All Members
3. Search Member (Details & BMI)
4. Delete Member
5. Exit
Just type the number of your choice and hit Enter!

   Important Note
Data Persistence: Currently, this system uses in-memory storage. This means that if you close the program (Exit), the member list will be reset. It is designed this way for simplicity and demonstration purposes.

 Future Improvements
If I were to expand this project later, I would add:

File Handling (.csv or .json): To save member data so it doesn't disappear when the program closes.

Input Validation: Stronger checks to ensure phone numbers are valid or IDs aren't left blank.

Subscription Tracking: Adding dates to track when a membership expires.
